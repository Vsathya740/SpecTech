	<h2>About Us</h2>
  <hr>
<p>
A specification often refers to a set of documented requirements to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service. A specification is often a type of technical standard. <br>

There are different types of technical or engineering specifications (specs), and the term is used differently in different technical contexts. They often refer to particular documents, and/or particular information within them.<br>

A technical specification (tech spec) is a Website that explains what a product is. Our website gives a variety of brands specifications along with their rumors. It is important to know what a brand or product is upto when a person is willing to buy it.<br>
 So here we provide Specs of various products and their reviews. 
You can also add your comments on particular products and that will be recorded in our database and basing on that we review a product.

Not only mobiles and laptops we also give updates regarding the latest firmawares and builds of phones tablets and laptops.<br> Its hard to conclude a product
 by seeing its picture or specs so we provide an unboxing videos too, so that you can get how the device looks in real time and how it works. <br>

 Our website is still under construction phase, later we will add more detailed specifications along with a new interface with which you can easily interact and know the things here. <br><br>
 We provide the latest news and rumors from verified sources which will become a product soon. You can comment and rate the product which helps us to review those products.
