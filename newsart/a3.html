	 	 	<h2 >iPhone 12, 12 mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max pricing roundup</h2>
	 	 	<hr>
	 	 	As we're sure you're aware, Apple announced four new iPhones today, marking the biggest roster expansion ever.
	 	    We've got the iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max.

            The new iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro will go on pre-order on October 16 for the first wave of countries, with in-store availability starting on October 23. The iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max will go on pre-order on November 6, and will ship on November 13.<br>

            For the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro the second wave of availability, which includes India, will happen on October 30.

          Now, if you've been wondering how much you're going to have to pay for one of Apple's latest, here's the nitty gritty.
          All of the prices below are for the entry-level storage option - that is 64GB for the iPhone 12 and 12 mini, and 128GB for the Pro and Pro Max.

         Note that in the US, the unlocked iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 are $30 more expensive than what's listed here as the minimum price. The cheapest price is available at AT&T and Verizon, while if you buy from T-Mobile, Sprint, or unlocked you are subject to that $30 premium for whatever reason.
